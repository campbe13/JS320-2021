# XHR XmlHTTPResponse 
XHR was the old way of accessing RESTful APIs via JavaScript, it is being replaced by Fetch API

You are asked to take code that uses XHR and to refactor it to use the Fetch API

You have been given a working application at [korra](https://korra.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/~tricia/js/09-xhr/sunriseset/) that uses XMLHttpRequests to make a GET request to a RESTful API.

The API used is https://sunrise-sunset.org/api/. 
Download this application from [starter](starter-good-api/) and make the necessary changes to use the Fetch API instead of XHR to make the request. 
Note that you donâ€™t have to restart from scratch!
