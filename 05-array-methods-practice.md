## Week 5 JavaScript – arrays, array methods

This exercise has a few quick questions. Great Test 1 practice! Use your browser’s console to write the statements/expressions. Try to use arrow functions where appropriate.
Refer to the MDN site if you are stuck, ex [useful string methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Useful_string_methods)

1. Declare an array with the elements 'red', 'green', 'blue'
1. Use the forEach method to iterate over the array and write the uppercase word to the console.
1. Use the push method to add an element 'yellow'
1. Use the unshift method to add an element 'violet'
1. Use the map method to get a new array with all elements in uppercase letters
1. Use the filter method on the new array to get a new array with only those elements with lengths >= 5.
1. Check the contents of the three arrays, are they as you expect? 

A little deeper, given this array

JavaScript```let myArray = [ "Ryu", "Ken", "Chun-Li", "Cammy", "Guile", "Sakura", "Sagat", "Juri" ]```

Create a new array for each of the following (there is an array method for some use that but also write your own, for practice)
1. Remove the last item in the array.
1. Add two new names to the end of the array.
1. Create a new array that contains each item in the myArray with its index number after the name inside parentheses, for example Ryu (0). 
1. Finally, join the array items together in a single string called myString, with a separator of " - ".
