# React convert a plain old JavaScript app to React 
This lab is to convert an existing POJS form example to React 
The html & code is in [webstorage](webstorage)

it's running here on [korra](https://korra.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/~tricia/js/webstorage/02-demo-input-JSON-webstore-localStorage/JSON.html)

It uses web storage, but ignore that  until the last step

1. change the file name to extension .jsx, add react, reactdom and babel scripts to the html 
1. start by setting up a React component class or function to display the form use  `ReactDOM.render()`
1. when the form displays properly add submit behaviour, log the data 
1. when the data logs properly update the React component or a separate component to display it 
1. when the data is displayed properly add the storage functions

This code [sunrise/set on korra](https://korra.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/~tricia/js/13-react-plus/03-form-react-sunrise-use-state/)  does something similar (form & api data rendered in a React component)
