# React first react exercise
<!--
* From reactjs.org [Add React in one minute](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html)
-->
This lab is to convert an existing POJS form example to React 
The html & code is in [webstorage](webstorage)

it's running here on [korra](https://korra.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/~tricia/js/webstorage/02-demo-input-JSON-webstore-localStorage/JSON.html)

It uses web storage, but ignore that  until the last step

# start by setting up a React component class or function to display the form use  `ReactDOM.render()`

# when the form displays properly add submit behaviour, log the data

# when the data logs properly update the React component or a separate component to display it 

# when the data is displayed properly add the storage functions
