# Convert static HTML to a React component
Your boss wants to reuse the shopping list  as a React component. 
Take a copy of the  the code here [index.html](index.html) you are going to convert it.


Add javascript
1. in the html replace everything in the body with `<div id="here"></div>`
1. edit the empty javascript file to add your codd
1. define a React component for the shopping list, ex
`class ShoppingList extends React.Component {`
1. render the component on the here div
1. once the component renders properly change `Rowlf` from static to being passed in via props, ex
`<Shoppinglist name="Rowlf"/>`
